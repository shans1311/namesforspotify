            <h1>TEEHEEHow it works</h1>
            <p>This website was created to allow users to generate names for their spotify playlists. This is done by first fetching your spotify data. The website does not fetch data it does not need. The only data it fetches is: Your most listened to tracks, artists and genres.</p>
            <p>After this data is collected from your spotify account, namesforspotify utilizes AI through OpenAI and ChatGPT. And assists this AI in generating playlists for you based on your spotify data. Its that simple.</p>
            <p>This project is open-source and you can access the code through my <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository" style="font-weight: bold; color: #8C9C9F; text-decoration: none;">GitHub</a>.</p>
